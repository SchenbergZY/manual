# Publishing your book with a publisher
You can choose to publish your online book with a publisher. Publishers might have access to databases to place your book in, increasing findability of your book. Futhermore, you can benefit from the publisher's brand. However, it may have consequenses on the ease of editing, choice of platforms, versioning restrictions, and copyright and licensing considerations. 

For TU Delft employees, you can decide to publish via TU Delft OPEN interactive textbooks. Publishing will give you a copyright check, ISBN or DOI number, and registration in several shared databases but limits the amount of changes you can make to your book: for substantial changes a new published version is needed with an updated copyright checks. Small changes like typos can always be made, which are processed in the published version every hour.
In case of editing a book for a course during that actual course and/or your book has limited value outside your course's content, we advise you only to publish an archived version of your book whenever the academic year is over.
