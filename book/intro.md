# TeachBooks Manual

This manual is primarily designed for and by teachers for use in education, but should be a useful resource for anyone interested in creating and collaborating on a TeachBook: a <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/v1/"><img  style="display:inline-block; height:1.5em; width:auto; transform:translate(0, -0.15em)" src="images/logo-wide.svg" alt="Jupyter book v1"> v1</a> using the <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/"><img  style="display:inline-block; height:1.5em; width:auto; transform:translate(0, -0.15em)" src="images/sphinx-logo.svg" alt="Sphinx logo"> Sphinx backend</a> with additional editing tools and book features. Our aim is to provide a simple way to start book-making for new users (it only takes 10 clicks!), ease the editing process for anyone, and provide additional features developed for education-purposes. We hope you find this resource useful and refer back to it often.

TeachBooks originated at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, and some of the material in this Manual reflects tools and resources specific to TU Delft. With the exception of a few tools for which we have educational licenses at Delft, everything in this Manual is open source. Despite this, we are happy to grow our open source community beyond Delft and welcome contributions from all users.

Happy book building!

## How to Use this Manual

There are several "parts" to the manual:
- **Your First TeachBook!** introduces the essential platforms and workflows, and contains a _workshop_ that can be completed independently or as part of a TeachBooks training. We recommend even experienced Jupyter Book v1 users go through this material to better understand the TeachBooks vision on how to make books collaboratively, as this drives much of our tool development. The workshop is designed to be completed in 1-2 hours and does not require any prior knowledge or installation (just a GitHub account).
- **Getting Going!** begins with an overview of _User Types_, which are used to help understand which parts of the Manual are most relevant to you. Detailed software installation instructions, book and team setup and workflows are also provided in this part.
- The **Features** part describes a suite of tools that are useful for teachers, many of which are developed by TeachBooks contributors specifically for use in education. Many of these tools are illustrated in the **Examples**.
- A few special tools are included in the **Editing Tools** that are useful when writing content.

See the final chapters of this book (under **Miscellaneous**) for additional information about References, Credits, etc.
