# Overview

As TeachBooks, we collect a suite of existing open-source software so you don't have to! Some of the software is developed with our TA's to improve the learning experience of our students and ease the book-development process for our teachers. As the open-source software landscape changes rapidly, it is essential to keep in contact and share resources amongst ourselves to minimize maintenance and downtime for our book websites and focus on what really matters: teaching!

Since the list of TeachBook features is getting quite long, we have grouped them in categories:
- [Original Jupyter Book and Sphinx features](../basic-features/overview.md)
- [Easy editing process](./easy-editing.md)
- [Additional functionality](./sphinx_extensions.md)
- [Book styling](./visuals.md)
- [TeachBooks student-view features](./students.md)

Additionally, not all features are built and shared in the same way. We do our best to make sure that as many tools as possible are included automatically when using our TeachBooks Template Book; if you are not using the Template, we try to make sure each of our tools can be used independently. For transparency, tags will help differentiate between the different backgrounds of the features:
- {bdg-warning}`Javascript overlay`
- {bdg-success}`Chrome Extension`
- {bdg-white}`GitHub App and Javascript script`
- {bdg-link-secondary}`Python Package: teachbooks <./teachbooks_intro.html>`
- {bdg-link-light}`GitHub Reusable Action: Deploy Book workflow <../external/deploy-book-workflow/README.html>`
- {bdg-link-light}`GitHub Template: TeachBooks Template <../external/template/README.html>`
- {bdg-dark}`Git Workflow`
- {bdg-primary}`Sphinx Extension`
- {bdg-link-primary-line}`TeachBooks Favourites <./favourites.html>`
- {bdg-danger}`iframe`
- {bdg-success}`WebApp`

For each feature, the purpose, installation process and usage is elaborated in the respective sub-sections.

To see examples of these features, go to the [Examples chapter](../examples/overview.md).

As the [TeachBooks Python Package](./teachbooks_intro.md), the [Deploy Book Workflow](../external/deploy-book-workflow/README.md), [TeachBooks Favourites](./favourites.md) and the [TeachBook template](../external/template/README.md) are important tools that incorporate and deploy more than one feature, an additional explanation is provided here in subpages to this page in more detail, with links to other pages in this manual where individual features are described.
