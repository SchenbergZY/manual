# Sphinx exercise

This extensions provides an easy way to add exercises and solutions to your book. It is documented on https://ebp-sphinx-exercise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

TeachBooks has made some small modifications to the original extension, such that it works well with translated books.

## What does it do?

This extension defines exercises and solutions as new admonition types:

```{exercise}
:label: my-exercise

Recall that $n!$ is read as "$n$ factorial" and defined as
$n! = n \times (n - 1) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$.

There are functions to compute this in various modules, but let's
write our own version as an exercise.

In particular, write a function `factorial` such that `factorial(n)` returns $n!$
for any positive integer $n$.
```

````{solution} my-exercise
:label: my-solution

Here's one solution.

```{code-block} python
def factorial(n):
    k = 1
    for i in range(n):
        k = k * (i + 1)
    return k

factorial(4)
```
