# Additional functionality

This sections includes the features developed by TeachBooks which add functionality to the book. Most of them are implemented as sphinx extensions {bdg-primary}`Sphinx Extension`, which are plugins developed for the Sphinx documentation ecosystem (which Jupyter Book v1 and TeachBooks is built upon). They extend or modify Sphinx’s capabilities. Since Sphinx extensions are not an integral part of Jupyter Book and TeachBooks, as opposed to original jupyter-book v1 features, they must be installed and configured explicitly, for example in the `_config.yml` and `requirements.txt` files.
