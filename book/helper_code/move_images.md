# Move images to separate hosting

Storing big binary files like images in your git repository and book is not good practice: diffs on binary files don't make sense and blow up the size of your repository. Furthermore, the size of your book website blows up too. Therefore, you can consider hosting your binary files on a different server, as explained [here in an example for the MUDE-book](https://tudelft-mude.github.io/teacher/FTP.html). To take all the images of your existing book and update the relative links, [a Python script](./parse_images.py) has been developed. This script processes Markdown (`.md`) and Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files listed in a `_toc.yml` file. It identifies local image references (including MyST `figure` syntax) in these files, copies the images to a specified folder (`new_images`), and replaces the local image paths with a public URL (e.g., `https://files.mude.citg.tudelft.nl/<image_name>`).
